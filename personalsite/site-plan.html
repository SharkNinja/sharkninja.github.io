      <p>
        This home page will act as a hub for the two child pages. The purpose of the website as a whole is to display key information about server roles, channels, staff, and even rules. This website will try to answer anything regarding those things, and members will visit this website for the information they desire because the information on the website will be unique within its own context. </p>

      <h3>[Roles and Channels]</h3>
      <p>In this child page, people will be able to find out more about the roles and channels. There will be many confusions amongst members about which roles are what, how to get said roles, which channels are which, and how to access certain channels. As a result, this child page will contain detailed information about each and every role to answer every possible question, concern, or eliminated any type of confusion. Visitors will only come here because the information is unique within it's own context, as every server is unique and different. </p>
